                <h1>What are Sharks?</h1>
                <p>Sharks are a group of cartilaginous fish belonging to the class Chondrichthyes. They are characterized by their streamlined bodies, multiple rows of teeth, and a skeleton made of cartilage rather than bone. Sharks have been around for hundreds of millions of years and are well-adapted predators in aquatic ecosystems.</p>    
                <p>There are over 500 species of sharks, ranging in size from the small dwarf lanternshark, which is about 8 inches (20 cm) long, to the enormous whale shark, which can reach lengths of over 40 feet (12 meters). Sharks play a crucial role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems by controlling populations of other marine animals.</p>    
                <p>Sharks are known for their keen sense of smell, excellent vision, and the ability to detect electrical fields in the water. They are found in a wide range of marine environments, from coastal waters to the open ocean. While some species of sharks are known to be aggressive, most are not a threat to humans. Unfortunately, sharks face various threats, including overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution, leading to conservation concerns for many species.</p>
                <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Sharks are known for their impressive dental structures. They continually replace their teeth throughout their lives and may have multiple rows of teeth. Some sharks can shed thousands of teeth in their lifetime.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Many sharks have a special sense called electroreception, allowing them to detect electrical fields in the water. This sense helps them locate prey and navigate in their environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Sharks are fast and agile swimmers. The shortfin mako shark is considered one of the fastest fish in the ocean, capable of reaching speeds up to 60 mph.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Some species of sharks are known for their extensive migrations. For example, the great white shark can travel thousands of miles across the ocean.</p></li>
